  target="_blank" title="korea news">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for
 <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and
 render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure
 of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into
the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and
 other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
  Tags such as and directly introduce content into the page.</p>

  <p>Other tags such as surround and provide information about document text and may
      include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags,
       but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

<p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which
 affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look
 and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of
  the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of
   CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2]</p>
